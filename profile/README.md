# Cumulus Suite Actions

This GitHub org (`cumulus-actions`) implements the Cumulus Suite GitHub Actions framework, a set of Actions and reusable Workflows that make it easy to adopt Cumulus Suite automation in Salesforce projects.

To learn how to consume these Actions for your own projects, check out [Run CumulusCI from GitHub Actions](https://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/en/stable/github-actions.html) in the [CumulusCI Documentation](https://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/).
